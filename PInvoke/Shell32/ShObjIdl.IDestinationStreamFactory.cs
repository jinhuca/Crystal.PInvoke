	/// <summary>Exposes a method for manually copying a stream or file before applying changes to properties.</summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// The default copy-on-write behavior provided by IPropertyStore causes the entire source stream to be duplicated during a write
	/// operation. This can be costly for large streams, especially when a large portion of the stream is to be changed.
	/// <c>IDestinationStreamFactory</c> provides an alternative for the property handler author, who can use it manually to ensure that
	/// property changes do not corrupt the stream in case of failure. To do this, the author marks the handler as NoTransactedMode in the
	/// handler's CoClass registry key, and queries the stream for this interface.
	/// </remarks>
