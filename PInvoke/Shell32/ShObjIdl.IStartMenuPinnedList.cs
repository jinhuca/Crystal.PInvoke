		/// Any shortcut installed by an application might have been subsequently pinned by the user, and there is no way for an application
		/// to know this. Therefore, we recommend that, during uninstallation, all applications call IStartMenuPinnedList::RemoveFromList on
		/// each shortcut they installed.
		/// </para>

		/// Note that <c>IStartMenuPinnedList</c> does not remove the shortcuts themselves, it only unpins them. Applications first call

		/// In Windows 8, the Start screen replaces the legacy Start menu. CLSID_StartMenuPin and IStartMenuPinnedList are present in Windows
